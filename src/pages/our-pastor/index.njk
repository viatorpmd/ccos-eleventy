    <p>Lester Austin, son of Eugene and Avie Austin, surrendered to preach in August of 1970 at Highland Baptist Church under the pastorate of Bro. Raymond Caudill. Bro. Lester, his wife Louise, and their daughters, Annette, Pam, and Kim, came to Laura in July of 1971, when members of the church extended the call for him to be pastor. Bro. Lester accepted the call of pastor of our church on December 29, 1971. The Austin’s last daughter, Becky, was born during Bro. Lester’s third year as pastor. Bro. Lester and Sister Louise have been married since October 17, 1963.</p>
